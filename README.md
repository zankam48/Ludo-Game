## 🎮 How to Play

### 🎲 Game Flow

1.  Choose the number of players (2-4).
2.  Each player selects a color (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow).
3.  Players take turns rolling the dice (Press any key).
4.  If a 6 is rolled, a piece can enter the board from home.
5.  Move your pieces along your path to the goal.
6.  Landing on an opponent’s piece? Kick them back home!
7.  First player to move all 4 pieces to the goal wins!

### 📜 Game Rules

-   Players can only move a piece if it’s not blocked.
-   Rolling a 6 grants an extra turn.
-   The last player remaining loses.
-   Safe zones protect pieces from being kicked.
